## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the appropriate variables.

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

To have the frontend default to a different network, make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`,
change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `{yourNetworkId}`, and change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g.
`https://{yourNetwork}.infura.io/v3/{yourKey}`.

## Dev Process

* Developer starts a new feature or bug fix: The developer creates a new branch off the dev branch. The branch name could be something related to the feature or bug being fixed.
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature_branch
```
* Developer works on the code: The developer makes changes to the code, commits them, and then pushes the changes to the remote feature_branch.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin feature_branch
```
* Merge changes to dev branch: The changes can be merged into the dev branch. This should be done through a Pull Request (PR). Once the PR is approved, it can be merged.
* Fleek CI/CD deploys dev to staging: Fleek is set up to automatically deploy the dev branch to a staging environment for QA testing whenever new changes are pushed to it.
* Merge changes to main branch: Once the QA testing is done and everything is approved, the changes can be merged into the main branch. Again, this should be done through a PR for the purposes of code review.
* Fleek CI/CD deploys main to production: Fleek is set up to automatically deploy the main branch to the production environment whenever new changes are pushed to it.
